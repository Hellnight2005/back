GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 .

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 . 

********************************************************************************

09/06/2012

GHCNM v3.2.0 is released with various software related bug fixes.  More detailed
information concerning the v3.2.0 software changes can be found here:

ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/techreports/Technical%20Report%20NCDC%20No12-02-3.2.0-29Aug12.pdf

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger
and a reworking of internal arrays for more efficient operations. Tech Note:

********************************************************************************

05/12/2011

Maximum (TMAX) and Minimum (TMIN) temperature data are now being posted to ftp.
However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files
that still contain the word "beta" (including documentation and web site).  We
are working to remove those references.

********************************************************************************

04/12/2011

GHCNMv3 "latest" files are being refreshed daily on the NCDC FTP.

********************************************************************************

04/08/2011

in anticipation of the Government shutdown, updating the ghcnm.latest.*
files has been suspended

********************************************************************************

04/01/2011

interuption in FTP server access caused data flow to fail. GCHNMv3 stopped
working.

********************************************************************************

03/17/2011

current estimated plus adjusted (ghcnm.latest.qae.tar.gz) was removed from
posting. Please contact team (ncdc.ghcnm@noaa.gov) for dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

06/09/2015

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate

07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at

to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 .

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger

However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use

time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger
and a reworking of internal arrays for more efficient operations. Tech Note:
Technical Report NCDC No12-01-Distribution.pdf
Is available at:
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/techreports/

********************************************************************************

05/12/2011

Maximum (TMAX) and Minimum (TMIN) temperature data are now being posted to ftp.
However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files
that still contain the word "beta" (including documentation and web site).  We
are working to remove those references.

********************************************************************************

04/12/2011

GHCNMv3 "latest" files are being refreshed daily on the NCDC FTP.

********************************************************************************

04/08/2011

in anticipation of the Government shutdown, updating the ghcnm.latest.*

********************************************************************************

04/01/2011

interuption in FTP server access caused data flow to fail. GCHNMv3 stopped

********************************************************************************

03/17/2011

current estimated plus adjusted (ghcnm.latest.qae.tar.gz) was removed from
posting. Please contact team (ncdc.ghcnm@noaa.gov) for dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

06/09/2015

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias

GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions.

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 . 

********************************************************************************

09/06/2012

GHCNM v3.2.0 is released with various software related bug fixes.  More detailed

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger
and a reworking of internal arrays for more efficient operations. Tech Note:

********************************************************************************

05/12/2011

Maximum (TMAX) and Minimum (TMIN) temperature data are now being posted to ftp.
However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files
that still contain the word "beta" (including documentation and web site).  We
are working to remove those references.

********************************************************************************

04/12/2011

GHCNMv3 "latest" files are being refreshed daily on the NCDC FTP.

********************************************************************************

posting. Please contact team (ncdc.ghcnm@noaa.gov) for dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

06/09/2015

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 . 

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger

However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may

variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 . 

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger
and a reworking of internal arrays for more efficient operations. Tech Note:

********************************************************************************

05/12/2011

Maximum (TMAX) and Minimum (TMIN) temperature data are now being posted to ftp.
However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files
that still contain the word "beta" (including documentation and web site).  We
are working to remove those references.

********************************************************************************

04/12/2011

GHCNMv3 "latest" files are being refreshed daily on the NCDC FTP.

posting. Please contact team (ncdc.ghcnm@noaa.gov) for dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon

into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 .

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger

********************************************************************************

05/12/2011

Maximum (TMAX) and Minimum (TMIN) temperature data are now being posted to ftp.
However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files
that still contain the word "beta" (including documentation and web site).  We
are working to remove those references.

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

02/07/2012

GHCNM v3.1.1 is released with changes in scripts due to asynchronous execution
problems. Also added ability to add new stations automatically when their 
period of record increased enough to process and improved testing when not
enough neighbors to estimate adjustments.

********************************************************************************

11/04/2011

GHCNMv3.1.0 is released with several corrections revealed by Daniel Rothenberger
and a reworking of internal arrays for more efficient operations. Tech Note:
Technical Report NCDC No12-01-Distribution.pdf
Is available at:
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v3/techreports/

********************************************************************************

05/12/2011

Maximum (TMAX) and Minimum (TMIN) temperature data are now being posted to ftp.
However, these data will probably only be updated weekly as opposed to daily for
mean temperature (TAVG). 

********************************************************************************

05/02/2011

GHCNM v3.0.0 is officially released.  The "beta" status is removed.  Users may 
notice for the next week or so a few dangling references within dataset files
that still contain the word "beta" (including documentation and web site).  We
are working to remove those references.

********************************************************************************

04/12/2011

GHCNMv3 "latest" files are being refreshed daily on the NCDC FTP.

********************************************************************************

04/08/2011

in anticipation of the Government shutdown, updating the ghcnm.latest.*
files has been suspended

********************************************************************************

04/01/2011

interuption in FTP server access caused data flow to fail. GCHNMv3 stopped
working.

********************************************************************************

03/17/2011

current estimated plus adjusted (ghcnm.latest.qae.tar.gz) was removed from
posting. Please contact team (ncdc.ghcnm@noaa.gov) for dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/02/2011

added "Colonial Era Archive" data (source flag="J") to a little over 150 
existing stations.

********************************************************************************

01/2011

Added "World Weather Records" (WWR) data to existing WWR already carried through
via GHCNM v2.  WWR are now identified by source flag="W".

********************************************************************************

12/17/2010

two spatial qc checks ("S" and "T") eliminated and replaced with spatial check
used in v2 (now set to "S" qc flag), documentation updated to reflect changes.

********************************************************************************

12/16/2010

initial build from GHCNM v2, now occurs using 'clone' file, so previously qc'd
v2 data (formerly set to missing), are carried through as non-missing, but
subjected to new v3 qc suite.

********************************************************************************

11/18/2010

"stnelev" and "grelev" fields should now both be in meters.  Previously, some 
stations were reported in different units (e.g. dekameters vs. meters). 
GHCNM, V3, status file 

(users can use this file to determine overall current status, including 
information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

06/09/2015

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 .

information related to previous changes and errata).

DISCLAIMER: The status file does not record every possible change that may
have occurred from one version to another.  This would be impractical for a
variety of reasons. Therefore if a user is interested in discovering every 
possible difference between two different file versions, they will need to 
construct their own program to determine all possible changes between the file
versions. 


********************************************************************************

09/19/2019

GHCNM version 3 is no longer operational (TAVG, TMAX amd TMIN).  Users should use
GHCNM version 4 for TAVG, found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v4/

In addition Version 4 TMAX and TMIN is under development and will be available in
the future.

********************************************************************************

07/19/2017

New De Bilt (station="63306260000") time series (per KNMI recommendation) added from
KNMI (source=https://climexp.knmi.nl/data/ilabrijn.dat) 
into tomorrow's processing run (valid for 07.20.2017 [and later] processing run)

********************************************************************************

03/11/2017

User feedback indicated a problem with some mean temperature data for select stations in 
Ireland.  The problems were traced to a particular data source (MCDW), and for
the time being until that source is corrected, the data are now being sourced
to the UK Met Office "Climat" data ("K" source flag"), which are believed to
be the correct values.  The data changeover to the UK Met Office has occurred, but 
the source flag ("K") for the corrected values was inadvertently left out.  Those 
source flags should be added within the next production cycle.

********************************************************************************

06/09/2015

GHCNM v3.3.0 is now operational, effective 06/09/2015.

********************************************************************************

05/28/2015

GHCNM version 3.2.2 will be replaced by version 3.3.0 in early June, 2015.
Information on this change is available in Technical Report GHCNM-No15-01.

********************************************************************************

07/14/2014

On or around 06/06/2014, there was an ingest problem with the "C" source data, 
(unpublished MCDW), and this caused a signficant reduction of data from that
source.  However, much of the data were still available through an alternate
source (UK Met Office, "K" source flag).  The ingest problem was resolved on
07/10/2014, and the expected frequency of "C" source data was restored.

********************************************************************************

10/17/2013

Government operations have been restored, and regular monitoring of GHCN-Monthly 
will now resume.  During the shutdown of government operations, some ingest of
recent international data were not received.  These data should be restored
with the next processing cycle (e.g. 10/18/2013).

********************************************************************************

10/01/2013

During the shutdown of government operations, GHCN-Monthly will continue to 
update automatically, but will not be monitored by the GHCN-Monthly team.  We
will also be unable to answer questions submitted to NCDC.GHCNM@noaa.gov until
after government operations resume.

********************************************************************************

08/03/2013

Version 3.2.2 was released on 8/3/2013.  This minor update to GHCN-M includes
several bug fixes, which involved data feed transmission issues, improving 
source code efficiency, accommodating changes in GHCND, and data
improvements.
 
********************************************************************************

03/21/2013

Station 12861497000, NEMA was believed to have incorrectly transmitted data
for February, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon as corrections
become available and can be verified they will be reinserted into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

03/20/2013

Mongolian station data for February, 2013 were retransmitted with incorrect data
sometime on or around March 12, 2013.  These data have been removed and as soon
as corrections become available and can be verified they will be reinserted
into the dataset.

********************************************************************************

02/15/2013

Version 3.2.1 was released on 2/12/2013. This minor update to GHCN-M includes
the use of updated data to improve quality control and correction processes of
other U.S. stations and neighboring stations in Canada and Mexico. It also
includes a correction to an omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias
correction process that had been present in version 3.2.0 since October 22,
2012. The algorithm that was specifically designed to correct for observing
time changes based on station history information was omitted from the USHCN
bias correction process. The Pairwise Homogeneity Algorithm continued to
function and corrected most of the time of observation issues, which minimized
the effect of this processing omission. Additional details are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/2013/1/supplemental/page-5 . 

********************************************************************************
